It was a classification problem
So first did data preprocessing ,  removed null value (or filled with mean) , checked for outliers
Then did EDA - with heatmap found correlation withing the data and removed least correlated data
Use 4 algorithms 1. logistic regression 2.knn 3. decision Tree 4.Random Forest 
used cross val score to find out the best model
